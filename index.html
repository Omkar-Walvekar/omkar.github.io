<h2>iphone 12pro</h2> <img src="12pro.jpg" width="200px" height="100px">
<p>iPhone 12 Pro works with existing power adapters, EarPods with Lightning Connector and USB-A to Lightning cables. Because there are billions of those out in the world, new ones often go unused. So we’re removing them from the box — across the entire iPhone family. This reduces carbon emissions and avoids the mining and use of precious materials. It also shrinks the package, allowing more boxes per shipment and fewer shipments overall. We’re transitioning our manufacturing partners to renewable energy as well. Altogether, this eliminates over 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

To charge your new iPhone, you can continue to use your USB-A to Lightning cable. Or you can take advantage of fast charging with the USB-C to Lightning cable now included in the box, which works with existing USB-C power adapters and computer ports.</p>

<p>
As part of our efforts to reach our environmental goals, iPhone 11 does not include a power adapter or EarPods. Included in the box is a USB‑C to Lightning cable that supports fast charging and is compatible with USB‑C power adapters and computer ports.

We encourage you to re‑use your current USB‑A to Lightning cables, power adapters, and headphones which are compatible with this iPhone. But if you need any new Apple power adapters or headphones, they are available for purchase.
